# Trusted peers

Iroha is a blockchain ledger, and for it to work optimally and be Byzantine-fault tolerant with the maximum number of faults allowed, it needs to be started with a set number of peers: 4, 7, 10 … 3f+1, where f is the number of faults. Therefore, when you want to start an Iroha deployment you should already know a number of peers that you can trust, and join their blockchain. The way this works in the examples is that you specify in four`config.json` files, four peers with their public keys and API addresses.
Since Iroha does not have automatic peer discovery, the only other way to make peers known to each other is by using the `iroha_client_cli` to register new peers. This is not too difficult with the provided client libraries. In fact, using Python’s beautiful soup, the curated list of peers can be updated, registered and un-registered on its own.
