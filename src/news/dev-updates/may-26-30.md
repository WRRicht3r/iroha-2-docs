# Hyperledger Iroha Developer Update (Week of May 26‚Äì30, 2025)

This week in the Hyperledger Iroha project, we saw a flurry of activity with new features merged, important bugs fixed, and lively discussions in the community. Below is a summary of the week‚Äôs GitHub Pulse activity, highlighting the key stats and developments to keep you in the loop.

### By the Numbers

- **Total Commits:** 12 commits were merged into the main branch over the week (across 3 pull requests).
- **Pull Requests:** 2 new PRs were opened and 3 PRs were merged (closed) during the week.
- **Issues:** The community created 9 new issues and closed 2 existing issues in the same period.

These numbers show robust engagement ‚Äì with multiple features in flight and ongoing attention to bug tracking and resolution.

## Merged Features & Updates

Several significant improvements were merged into Iroha‚Äôs codebase this week, enhancing both functionality and developer experience:

- **Test Network Modularity:** A refactoring update *‚Äúfurther enhance modularity of test network‚Äù* (PR [#5424](https://github.com/hyperledger-iroha/iroha/pull/5424)) was merged, improving how the test network components are structured and reused. This cleanup will make it easier to spin up and maintain test deployments of Iroha, benefiting developers writing and running integration tests.

- **Consistency Script Enhancements:** A new feature update ‚Äú`enhance consistency.sh`‚Äù (PR [#5436](https://github.com/hyperledger-iroha/iroha/pull/5436)) was merged to refine Iroha‚Äôs consistency check script. The `consistency.sh` tool is now more robust, helping ensure configuration and data remain consistent ‚Äì a small but important quality-of-life improvement for dev-ops and release processes.

- **Environment-Only Configuration:** Another merged change, *‚Äúcould run iroha with envs only; add iroha tests‚Äù* (PR [#5394](https://github.com/hyperledger-iroha/iroha/pull/5394)), allows Iroha to be run using only environment variables for configuration. This is a big win for containerization and deployment flexibility. Along with this feature, new tests were added to validate that Iroha behaves correctly when configured via environment variables, increasing confidence in this new capability.

Together, these updates make Iroha more modular, easier to configure in cloud environments, and smoother to test. All three merged PRs were contributed by core maintainer **0x009922**, who has been driving much of this week‚Äôs development effort.


## Bug Fixes & Improvements

In addition to new features, the team tackled various bugs and technical debt:

- **Wasm Event Handling:** Two long-standing issues related to Iroha‚Äôs WebAssembly smart contracts were resolved. The issues *‚ÄúWasm executable should declare the union of possible events‚Äù* and *‚ÄúDedup wasm blobs‚Äù* were closed this week, indicating that fixes have been implemented. These fixes ensure that events emitted by WASM modules are properly declared and that duplicate WASM binaries are eliminated, improving the reliability and efficiency of smart contract processing.

- **CI and Build Reliability:** Attention was given to continuous integration and build processes. A new PR was opened to add multi-architecture Docker image support for Iroha‚Äôs build (expanding compatibility to multiple CPU architectures). Another PR (opened as *‚Äúfix(ci): disable Rust cache for wasm workspace‚Äù*) addresses an issue with caching in the CI pipeline. These improvements, once merged, will speed up build times and make the developer workflow more robust.

- **Test Stability:** Community members reported a *‚ÄúFlaky integration tests regression after #5380‚Äù* (Issue [#5432](https://github.com/hyperledger-iroha/iroha/issues/5432)). In response, maintainers are investigating and adding a retry mechanism for failed time-based triggers (Issue [#5431](https://github.com/hyperledger-iroha/iroha/issues/5431)) to improve test reliability. Squashing nondeterministic test behavior is a priority to keep the test suite trustworthy.

Overall, these fixes and enhancements polish the Iroha codebase ‚Äì from core contract logic to the project‚Äôs CI/CD infrastructure ‚Äì ensuring a smoother experience for both developers and users.

## Community Contributions & Recognition

**We‚Äôd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to Iroha this week. üéâ**
In particular, **[0x009922](https://github.com/0x009922)** deserves special recognition for spearheading multiple improvements (from code refactors to new features) and closing out bugs. All 3 merged PRs and both closed issues this week were handled by 0x009922, demonstrating an outstanding level of commitment.

Community contributors also played an essential role by opening 9 new issues, bringing fresh ideas and bug reports into the project. Notably, one contributor proposed a series of enhancements around Trigger safety and permissions ‚Äì covering topics like ensuring triggers inherit proper authorities, introducing quota-based deterrence, and refining event subscription permissions. These suggestions will help guide future improvements in Iroha‚Äôs triggers module. Another community-reported issue identified a CI configuration glitch (pr_docker_compose.yml not working), which will help us fix our development workflow. Each of these contributions is valuable, and we appreciate the community‚Äôs vigilance in making Iroha better.

**Huge thanks to every participant this week ‚Äì whether you wrote code, reported an issue, or reviewed a discussion. Iroha‚Äôs progress is truly a team effort.**

## Ongoing Discussions & Fun Facts

The Iroha repository was abuzz with discussion. In fact, there are 9 open conversations on issues/PRs that are still being actively discussed and refined. One highlight was PR [#5430](https://github.com/hyperledger-iroha/iroha/pull/5430) (*‚Äú`fix(triggers)!`: switch to per-transaction execution with depth limit‚Äù*), which sparked a lively debate among the developers. This single pull request accumulated 59 new comments over the week! Such extensive discussion shows the team‚Äôs dedication to reviewing changes thoroughly ‚Äì especially for a critical feature affecting trigger execution. The dialogue ensures that any major changes to Iroha‚Äôs transaction processing are safe, well-understood, and agreed upon by reviewers before merging.

It‚Äôs also worth noting the breadth of topics in flight. From WASM runtime adjustments to permissions for queries and even housekeeping like dependency bumps, the range of active threads spans all layers of the project. This reflects a healthy, dynamic project where improvements are happening on multiple fronts (core protocol, smart contracts, infrastructure, etc.) simultaneously.

That‚Äôs all for this week‚Äôs update! It‚Äôs been an exciting week for Hyperledger Iroha, with meaningful progress made in code quality, new capabilities, and community engagement. We encourage everyone to test out the latest changes, continue reporting issues or suggestions, and join the conversations on GitHub. Thank you to our contributors for their hard work, and to the community for staying involved. Let‚Äôs keep the momentum going into next week‚Äôs development cycle!
