# Hyperledger Iroha Developer Update – Week of May 9–16, 2025

For the week of May 9 – 16, 2025, the Hyperledger Iroha repository saw 3 pull requests merged and 5 new pull requests opened by contributors. The community also submitted 2 new issues, with 0 issues closed during this period. Development activity was driven by multiple contributors (at least 4 different developers), reflecting ongoing community engagement.

## Merged Pull Requests (3)
This week, 3 pull requests were merged (by 2 contributors) focusing on documentation, CI, and code quality improvements:
- **Documentation Fix**: `chore(docs)`: fix cargo doc warnings ([#5427](https://github.com/hyperledger-iroha/iroha/pull/5427)) was merged to resolve warnings in generated documentation. This cleanup helps keep the Rust docs build clean and free of errors.

- **CI Labeler Update:** `ci`: fix labeler ([#5426](https://github.com/hyperledger-iroha/iroha/pull/5426)) was merged to correct the repository's automated labeling workflow. This ensures pull requests are tagged correctly by the continuous integration pipeline.

- **Lint Cleanup:** `chore(lints)`: address lint warnings ([#5420](https://github.com/hyperledger-iroha/iroha/pull/5420)) was merged, eliminating various compiler and linter warnings. These changes improve code quality and maintain a warning-free codebase.

All three merged PRs were relatively small in scope (documentation and tooling changes), but they collectively improve the developer experience and code health of the project.

## New & Ongoing Pull Requests (5 Opened)
There were 5 new pull requests opened this week (by 4 contributors) addressing new features and improvements:

- **WASM Execution Fuel:** `feat(wasm)`: dynamic fuel in executor ([#5421](https://github.com/hyperledger-iroha/iroha/pull/5421)) was opened to introduce dynamic fuel control in the WASM execution engine. This feature will likely allow more flexible gas/fuel limits for smart contracts, improving how Iroha handles resource consumption for WASM-based smart contracts.

- **CI Action Upgrade:** `chore(deps)`: bump `SonarSource/sonarqube-scan-action` from 5.0.0 to 5.2.0 ([#5422](https://github.com/hyperledger-iroha/iroha/pull/5422)) updates the SonarQube scanning action used in CI. Keeping CI dependencies up-to-date helps maintain robust static analysis and security scanning in the pipeline.

- **Test Network Refactor:** `refactor`: further enhance modularity of test network ([#5424](https://github.com/hyperledger-iroha/iroha/pull/5424)) was opened to improve the structure of the test network code. This refactoring aims to make the test networking components more modular and maintainable, which will aid in writing and running integration tests.

- **Multi-Platform Dev Images:** `ci`: enable platforms for dev image ([#5429](https://github.com/hyperledger-iroha/iroha/pull/5429)) enables building the development Docker image for multiple CPU architectures. This is a step toward providing multi-architecture support (e.g., building Iroha images for ARM64 vs. x86), addressing a long-standing request from the community.

- **Trigger Execution Fix:** `fix(triggers)!`: switch to per-transaction execution with depth limit ([#5430](https://github.com/hyperledger-iroha/iroha/pull/5430)) was opened as a breaking change to how triggers are executed. This fix changes trigger handling to execute on a per-transaction basis with a defined depth limit, likely to prevent recursive or unintended trigger invocations. It is an important stability fix that will need careful review due to its impact on existing trigger behavior.

These new PRs are under review and represent ongoing development. Notably, the WASM fuel feature and the trigger execution change are significant enhancements that will improve performance and reliability. The CI improvements (Sonar scanner bump and multi-platform images) demonstrate continued investment in project infrastructure.

## Issue Updates and Discussions
Two new issues were opened by a community member this week, highlighting areas for clarification and improvement:

- **Network Genesis Coordination:** *"What is the expected network behaviour when multiple peers submit different genesis blocks?"* (Issue [#5425](https://github.com/hyperledger-iroha/iroha/issues/5425)) was raised to clarify Iroha’s behavior in a scenario where peers might start with inconsistent genesis blocks. This question/issue probes the network’s fault tolerance and initialization logic, and discussion is ongoing to document or handle this case.

- **Test Framework Enhancement:** `iroha_test_network`: expose irohad output for assertions (Issue [#5423](https://github.com/hyperledger-iroha/iroha/issues/5423)) was opened as a feature request to improve the testing framework. The proposer suggests exposing the Iroha daemon’s output in the `iroha_test_network` utility, which would allow developers to make assertions based on node log output during tests (useful for diagnosing failures in automated tests).

No issues were closed this week, but active discussions continue on existing open issues. In particular, a critical consensus bug where a peer reports *"This peer is faulty... Restarting consensus (internal bug)"* and no new blocks are created is still under investigation. This issue ([#5230](https://github.com/hyperledger-iroha/iroha/issues/5230)) is a potential blocker for network stability, and developers are collaborating on debugging and resolving it. Additionally, the long-standing request for multi-architecture Docker image support remains an open topic of discussion, though progress is being made via the new PR for multi-platform dev images mentioned above. Other ongoing threads include discussions on configuration via environment variables and ensuring feature flags are additive – all indicating that the community is actively engaging to refine Iroha's robustness and usability.

Overall, this week’s development saw steady progress in cleaning up the codebase and improving infrastructure, while also pushing forward on new features like WASM execution control. Community contributions were evident in both code (new PRs) and feedback (new issues), which is great for the project’s growth. The team is addressing minor bugs and tech debt (docs, lints, CI) and tackling larger changes (trigger execution logic and multi-arch support). A few blockers (such as the consensus issue) are known and being worked on, but no new blockers emerged. Keep an eye on the open pull requests in review – next week should bring more updates as these changes get integrated.
